By Default, all device data is saved in dynamo. Once the device is configured, only data for the chosen fields are saved.
This means that no data is lost

Or I could say that the default is that no data gets saved until a unit is configured (once it is, I retrieve data from matching log files manually)
Even saving the logfiles though should probably be done via amazon. but a regular sql or postgresql db. 

I'm not sure. Regardless, on the front end

For admin users

View devices independantly
Graph data for a given range, date selectors, zooming panning, updating with user input
Tabular data with filters, searching, etc. This is partly done.

View DAS independantly. Have a page for viewing all info about a das. Have one graph where various parameters can be turned on/off etc. etc.

AWS DB plugin
datatables has searching, sorting, filtering
to limit calls I want searching to be triggered w/ enter or btn

db(db.table.fieldname='querytext').select()

there is a slight difference however where dynamo allows arbitrary name/alue paris. How to handel that?

one way: constantly manage a list in the regular db that is the unique fields (name in name/value) and maybe some info on the upper and lower bound data for each field

pros not sure cons lots of everhead kinf of complicated

another way: for any table have a set of core fields. For each item, map their fields to the core fields and then show the other information in a group below each record.

make sure if there are no additional fields, that there is no controls for collapsing and expanding the additional information!
