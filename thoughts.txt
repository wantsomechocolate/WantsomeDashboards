By Default, all device data is saved in dynamo. Once the device is configured, only data for the chosen fields are saved.
This means that no data is lost

Or I could say that the default is that no data gets saved until a unit is configured (once it is, I retrieve data from matching log files manually)
Even saving the logfiles though should probably be done via amazon. but a regular sql or postgresql db. 

I'm not sure. Regardless, on the front end

For admin users

View devices independantly
Graph data for a given range, date selectors, zooming panning, updating with user input
Tabular data with filters, searching, etc. This is partly done.

View DAS independantly. Have a page for viewing all info about a das. Have one graph where various parameters can be turned on/off etc. etc.
